# Remediation Queue

This file tracks sklearn targets that should not be ingested as publishable
atoms until the decomposition boundary is clarified.

## `sklearn.svm`

Deferred targets:

| Target | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LinearSVC` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L44` | Training is delegated to compiled liblinear internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `LinearSVR` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L367` | Training is delegated to compiled liblinear internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `SVC` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L623` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `NuSVC` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L900` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `SVR` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L1163` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `NuSVR` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L1357` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `OneClassSVM` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L1544` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |

Potential remediation path:

- Decide whether SVM estimators should be represented as limited
  estimator-state wrapper atoms with explicit audit limitations.
- Or ingest the underlying libsvm/liblinear source through a dedicated native
  or FFI-backed decomposition, with provenance and runtime validation at the
  solver boundary.

## `sklearn.tree`

Deferred targets:

| Target | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DecisionTreeClassifier` | `sklearn/tree/_classes.py:L707` | Training and prediction depend on Cython `sklearn.tree._tree`, `_splitter`, and `_criterion` internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed tree-building algorithm. |
| `DecisionTreeRegressor` | `sklearn/tree/_classes.py:L1114` | Training and prediction depend on Cython `sklearn.tree._tree`, `_splitter`, and `_criterion` internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed tree-building algorithm. |
| `ExtraTreeClassifier` | `sklearn/tree/_classes.py:L1456` | Training and prediction depend on Cython `sklearn.tree._tree`, `_splitter`, and `_criterion` internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed randomized tree-building algorithm. |
| `ExtraTreeRegressor` | `sklearn/tree/_classes.py:L1745` | Training and prediction depend on Cython `sklearn.tree._tree`, `_splitter`, and `_criterion` internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed randomized tree-building algorithm. |

Potential remediation path:

- Decide whether tree estimators should be represented as limited
  estimator-state wrapper atoms with explicit audit limitations.
- Or ingest the Cython/native tree builder, splitter, and criterion internals
  through a dedicated native or FFI-backed decomposition with solver-boundary
  provenance and parity tests.

## `sklearn.cluster` agglomerative hierarchy

Deferred targets:

| Target | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AgglomerativeClustering` | `sklearn/cluster/_agglomerative.py:L781` | Fit delegates tree construction and early-cut labeling to `ward_tree`, linkage builders, and compiled `sklearn.cluster._hierarchical` helpers; a Python atom would be an estimator wrapper rather than a fully decomposed hierarchical clustering algorithm. |
| `FeatureAgglomeration` | `sklearn/cluster/_agglomerative.py:L1121` | Feature clustering inherits the same agglomerative tree builder and compiled hierarchical helpers, so ingesting only fit/transform would hide the core merge algorithm. |
| `ward_tree` | `sklearn/cluster/_agglomerative.py:L184` | Structured Ward linkage uses compiled `_hierarchical.compute_ward_dist` and parent traversal helpers, while the unstructured path delegates to SciPy hierarchy; a publishable atom needs a direct decomposition or native/FFI provenance at that boundary. |

Potential remediation path:

- Decide whether these targets should be represented as limited hierarchy-state
  wrapper atoms with explicit audit limitations.
- Or ingest the compiled hierarchical helpers and SciPy linkage boundary
  through a dedicated native or FFI-backed decomposition with parity tests for
  structured and unstructured trees.

## `sklearn.cluster` density and KMeans native cores

Deferred targets:

| Target | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DBSCAN` | `sklearn/cluster/_dbscan.py:L201` | Fit computes neighborhoods in Python but delegates connected density expansion to compiled `sklearn.cluster._dbscan_inner.dbscan_inner`; wrapping the estimator would hide the core cluster-label propagation. |
| `dbscan` | `sklearn/cluster/_dbscan.py:L22` | Public helper delegates to `DBSCAN.fit`, which relies on compiled `dbscan_inner` for cluster expansion. |
| `BisectingKMeans` | `sklearn/cluster/_bisect_k_means.py:L83` | Recursive splits rely on sklearn KMeans routines whose Lloyd/Elkan update kernels are compiled; a direct atom would be a wrapper over native optimization loops. |
| `k_means` | `sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py:L296` | Public helper delegates to `KMeans.fit`, which calls compiled Lloyd or Elkan single-run kernels for centroid updates. |
| `KMeans` | `sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py:L1192` | Fit delegates the optimization loop to compiled `_kmeans_single_lloyd` or `_kmeans_single_elkan`; ingesting the estimator shell would not decompose the clustering algorithm. |
| `MiniBatchKMeans` | `sklearn/cluster/_kmeans.py:L1684` | Fit delegates minibatch centroid updates to compiled k-means kernels and OpenMP-threaded internals; a Python atom would hide the core update rule implementation. |

Potential remediation path:

- Keep `kmeans_plusplus` separate because its seeding logic can be considered
  for Python-level ingestion without claiming to ingest KMeans optimization.
- Decide whether DBSCAN and KMeans families should be ingested through native
  or FFI-backed kernels with explicit solver-boundary provenance and parity
  tests.

## `sklearn.cluster` HDBSCAN native hierarchy

Deferred target:

| Target | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HDBSCAN` | `sklearn/cluster/_hdbscan/hdbscan.py:L423` | Fit dispatches minimum-spanning-tree construction to `_hdbscan_brute` or `_hdbscan_prims` and tree backends, then condenses/extracts a density hierarchy; ingesting only the estimator shell would hide the core hierarchical density algorithm. |

Potential remediation path:

- Ingest HDBSCAN through the MST and hierarchy construction boundary with
  native/FFI provenance, including parity tests for brute-force, KD-tree,
  BallTree, sparse, and precomputed-distance modes.

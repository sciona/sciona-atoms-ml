# Remediation Queue

This file tracks sklearn targets that should not be ingested as publishable
atoms until the decomposition boundary is clarified.

## `sklearn.svm`

Deferred targets:

| Target | Source | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LinearSVC` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L44` | Training is delegated to compiled liblinear internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `LinearSVR` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L367` | Training is delegated to compiled liblinear internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `SVC` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L623` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `NuSVC` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L900` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `SVR` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L1163` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `NuSVR` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L1357` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |
| `OneClassSVM` | `sklearn/svm/_classes.py:L1544` | Training is delegated to compiled libsvm internals; a Python atom would be an opaque estimator wrapper rather than a decomposed algorithm. |

Potential remediation path:

- Decide whether SVM estimators should be represented as limited
  estimator-state wrapper atoms with explicit audit limitations.
- Or ingest the underlying libsvm/liblinear source through a dedicated native
  or FFI-backed decomposition, with provenance and runtime validation at the
  solver boundary.
